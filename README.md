[Feature scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling) is a
method used to normalize the range of variables or features of data. In
data processing, it is also known as *data normalization* and is usually
performed during the *data preprocessing* step. With the fuzzy feature
scaling/transformation, some useful knowledge may be extracted from
features, and the new rescaled vectors may tolerate the possible
uncertain information (such as outlier values, and rescaling of
categorical variables). Also, the classification methods can achieve
better accuracies using Fuzzy feature scaling methods.

## Installation

You can install the released version of fuzzyrescaler from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MaaniBeigy/fuzzyrescaler")
