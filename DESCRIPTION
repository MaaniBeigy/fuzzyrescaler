Description: Feature scaling is a method used to normalize the range of 
    variables or features of data. In data processing, it is also known as data 
    normalization and is usually performed during the data preprocessing step. 
    With the fuzzy feature scaling/transformation, some useful knowledge may 
    be extracted from features, and the new rescaled vectors may tolerate the 
    possible uncertain information (such as outlier values, and rescaling of 
    categorical variables). Also, the classification methods can achieve
    better accuracies using Fuzzy feature scaling methods. References are
